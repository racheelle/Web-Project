        Zahlé, known as the "Bride of the Beqaa" and the "City of Wine and Poetry," 
        is a resilient city with a history spanning centuries. Its culture is deeply 
        intertwined with the region's agricultural abundance, winemaking, and poetic 
        traditions. In 2013, it was designated a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy 
        and was recently named "World Wine City" for 2025 by the International 
        Organisation of Vine and Wine.
